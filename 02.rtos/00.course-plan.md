# Course Plan

Ashton's plan is in a google doc for [the moment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yep9oRWgR7SMAIgrqW1Y41D2W9mHnQ42xcQHFXZ1HQI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Labs

1. [Hello World!](https://github.com/brownbr61/bombastic-barnacle/blob/main/02.rtos/00.hello-world.md)
2. [The Taskmaster (threads)](https://github.com/brownbr61/bombastic-barnacle/blob/main/02.rtos/01.tasks.md)
3. [State and Mutexes and Semaphores, Oh My!](https://github.com/brownbr61/bombastic-barnacle/blob/main/02.rtos/02.state-mutexes-semaphores.md)
   1. What do you mean by state in this one?
4. [Mailboxes, Minding your Ps (processes) and Queues](https://github.com/brownbr61/bombastic-barnacle/blob/main/02.rtos/03.queue-mailboxes.md)
   1. What is a mailbox?
5. [Can, Bus, Can you do the Can Bus?](https://github.com/brownbr61/bombastic-barnacle/blob/main/02.rtos/04.can-bus.md)
6. [RTOS Scheduling](https://github.com/brownbr61/bombastic-barnacle/blob/main/02.rtos/05.rtos-scheduling.md)
   1. What kind of RTOS Scheduling will we be doing? Conceptual, or Physical?

## Project

A Project that uses the concepts learned in the labs to interact and integrate with other groups' designs to create a cohesive system (sensor data over antennae, maybe?)

- If EM communications aren't allowed (due to no Ham Radio license), supersonic ones could be doable. (We could hear the sound of IP traffic!)
