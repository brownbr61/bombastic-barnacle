# RTOS Learning Objectives

- Real-time systems and timing requirements
  - Real-time operating systems (RTOS)
    - Compare and Contrast the costs, benefits, and best uses of:
      - Bare Metal-based systems
      - RTOS-based systems
      - OS-based systems
    - Set up an RTOS based project
    - Initialize the operating system
    - Create tasks, locks and mutexes
      - *I think this is already covered in the Synchronization section; would you like that somewhere else?*
  - *Classify Timing Requirements as* **Hard, Firm, or Soft Real-Time Requirements**
  - **Prioritize tasks** *based on the hardness of their Real-Time Requirements*
  - **Analyze and Select Scheduling Algorithms** *based on their Real-Time Requirements*
- Models of Concurrency
  - Actor Model
    - *Not sure what this is about?*
  - Synchronization
    - *Create **Tasks** for parallel processing*

    - *Identify and Prevent cases of **Deadlock***
    - *Identify and Correct **Priority Inversion***
  - Event-/Interrupt- Driven Architecture
    - *Describe Event-Driven Systems with **State Machines***
    - **Implement Event-Driven Systems**
- Distributed Systems
  - Inter-Process Communication
    - *Implement **Queues** as an inter-process interface*
    - *Implement **Mailboxes** as an inter-process interface*
    - *Implement **Shared Memory** as an inter-process interface*
  - *Implement **Networking** Protocols*
    - Identify different network topologies
    - Apply the OSI model

    - *Evaulate System Performance based on Tests*
    - *Identify Risks from System Performance in Tests*
  - Ethics and risk
    - Identify risks and consequences in medical, IoT, automotive and aviation, autonomous vehicles, etc.
    - Evaluate safety risks in a system design
    - Specify uptime requirements for a system.
    - Understand emergent behavior, its sources and consequences.
